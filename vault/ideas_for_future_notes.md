# Ideas for future notes

- My understanding of foundational Buddhist ideas: (Impermanence / Suffering through attachment / Non-duality / Non-self)
- A common field of awareness
- Death as relaxation of the conscious field
- Metaphysical conjecture - RQD, time and space as a construct, ocean waves as an analogy
- Personal connection through the lens of Buddhism
- Stages of "enlightenment"
- Making the most of insights
- Current religion and its deviation from these principles into modern literalism
- An awareness remembering itself for the first time
- The sliding scale of awareness, and consciousness as type of awareness (self-aware)
- Materialism and technology as a distraction from reality
- The mind constructs a model of the world and maps on to it - what happens when the alignment is good, how this desire for good mapping can result in the same evidence mapping onto two opposing models
- There is only present - and the implications of this on how we live, or might want to live (the value of now). Reference 4000 Weeks.
