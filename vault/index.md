## Things aren't really colourful, reality is a construct

The normal experience of looking at a chair is to feel as though there is nothing between you, the observer, and the object. It feels almost as though light travels directly from the chair into your mind, but that the truth is far from that.

For a start, there are the obvious intermediaries. The lens of the eye focusing light, the retina translating that light into electrical signals, the transport of those signals to the mind, and then the brain interpreting those signals. However, the real magic of consciousness is something that exists beyond all that. We don't simple become aware of the location and properties of the chair, as we might assume a computer system would, we experience looking at the chair in a way that is hard to communicate with words, we _see_ the chair. 

Our awareness - by which I mean our consciousness at it's most impersonal and fundamental level - is like a passive observer of things which the occur in the field of awareness.

Throughout life, this awareness is observing a constructed inner a world, a colourful, spatial, audible, tactile model of the world. It is our minds which  render a blade of glass to look green, or the sky to look blue. The brain infers colour, it doesn't exist in the same sense in the outside world.

Colour is just a useful example here. The really interesting insight is that this concept extends to all of human experience. We do not experience the world directly, we are an awareness (within a mind, within a body) which observes that which the mind generates. Your reality is the understanding and experience you have of the world, but those are _internal_ phenomena. The illusion of consciousness to to make make that "reality" feel external.
