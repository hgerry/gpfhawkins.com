# A Sort of Buddhism

[About me](about_me.md)    [Ideas for future notes](ideas_for_future_notes.md)

This website is a collection of notes on consciousness, experience, and reality. I don't follow a particular school, but I am some sort of Buddhist. I generally prefer to intuit insights, and then try to understand them - rather than the other way around - but I think there is value in both approaches. 

I've written these pieces primarily as an exercise to developing and crystallise my thoughts.

## Notes

- [It's all in the mind](its_all_in_the_mind.md)
  _Using sight and colour as examples to understand our constructed internal reality, and how our experience is indirect_

- ["Awareness is impersonal, and universal"](universal_awareness.md.md)
  _Realising that consciousness is, at its core, an impersonal and common awareness, changes the identification of self _

- ["Personal metaphysical reckoning"](metaphysics.md.md)
  _My current understanding and best-guess of how everything works_
