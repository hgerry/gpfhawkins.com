# About Me

![](vault/me.jpeg)

I'm Gerry Hawkins, and I live in a small village in the south west of England called Wrington. I started writing notes on this website in 2026.

I'm a hardware engineer (I design circuits), and I studied Physics at university. 

I began engaging with the sorts of ideas outlined on this website in my mid-thirties. Away for the weekend with a small group of friends (walking/techno/ale/etc), we held a guided meditation, which turned out to be a profound experience for me. 

Please feel free to email me if you are interested to talk about any of this stuff:
