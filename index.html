<h1 id="a-sort-of-buddhism">A Sort of Buddhism</h1>
<p><a href="About%20Me.html">About Me</a></p>
<p>Here are some vingettes, written to develop and express my thoughts.
I don’t follow a particular school, but my theology and metaphysical
reckoning are fairly Buddhist. I generally prefer to intuit insights,
and then try to understand them - rather than the other way around. I
don’t claim this method to be more valid than another, it’s just the
path I have taken.</p>
<h2 id="its-all-in-the-mind">It’s all in the mind</h2>
<p>The normal experience of looking at an object is to feel as though
there is nothing between you, the observer, and the object. It feels
almost as though light travels directly from the object into your
conscious, and therefore that you are <em>directly</em> observing the
object itself - but this is not the case.</p>
<p>For a start, there are the obvious intermediaries. The lens, the
retina, and so on. The real magic of consciousness is something that
exists beyond all that. We don’t simply become aware of the location and
properties of the object, as we might assume a computer system would, we
experience looking at the chair in a way that is hard to communicate
with words - we <em>see</em> the chair.</p>

<p>Our awareness - by which I mean our consciousness at it’s most
impersonal and fundamental level - is like a passive observer, with
things appearing in that awareness.</p>
<p>Throughout life, this awareness is observing a constructed inner a
world, a colourful, spatial, audible, tactile model of the world. It is
our minds which render a blade of glass to look green, or the sky to
look blue. The brain infers colour, it doesn’t exist in the same sense
in the outside world.</p>
<p>Colour is just a useful example here. The really interesting insight
is that this concept extends to all of human experience. We do not
experience the world directly, we are an awareness (within a mind,
within a body) which observes that which the mind generates. Your
reality is the understanding and experience you have of the world, but
those are <em>internal</em> phenomena. The illusion of consciousness to
to make make that “reality” feel external.</p>
