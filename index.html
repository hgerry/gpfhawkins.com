      <h1>Creation Without Limitation</h1>
    </header>

    <p>
      This is a quiet page intended for reading. The design avoids visual noise,
      favouring contrast, spacing, and restraint over decoration.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is not to impress quickly, but to remain comfortable after
      several minutes of sustained attention. Colour is present, but never
      dominant.
    </p>

    <h2>Principles</h2>

    <p>
      Dark interfaces work best when they are not truly black. Warm greys
      reduce glare and allow subtle accents to feel intentional rather than
      ornamental.
    </p>

    <p>
      Headings use a serif face to introduce texture and rhythm, while body
      text remains neutral and familiar.
    </p>

    <h3>Example code block</h3>

    <pre><code>function writeClearly() {
  return "Reduce until nothing essential can be removed.";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      Links are understated. <a href="#">This is an example link</a>—visible,
      but not demanding attention.
    </p>
