<p>Buddhism, synths, and greenhouses.</p>
<h2 id="a-sort-of-buddhism">A Sort of Buddhism</h2>
<p>Here are some thoughts, notes, and essays - written to develop my
thoughts and express my ideas. I don’t follow a particular school, but
my theology and metaphysical reckoning is fairly close to general
Buddhist themes. I generally prefer to intuit insights, and then try to
understand them - rather than the other way around.</p>
<h2 id="things-arent-really-colourful-reality-is-a-construct">Things
aren’t really colourful, reality is a construct</h2>
<p>The normal experience of looking at a chair is to feel as though
there is nothing between you, the observer, and the object. It feels
almost as though light travels directly from the chair into your mind,
but that the truth is far from that.</p>
<p>For a start, there are the obvious intermediaries. The lens of the
eye focusing light, the retina translating that light into electrical
signals, the transport of those signals to the mind, and then the brain
interpreting those signals. However, the real magic of consciousness is
something that exists beyond all that. We don’t simple become aware of
the location and properties of the chair, as we might assume a computer
system would, we experience looking at the chair in a way that is hard
to communicate with words, we <em>see</em> the chair.</p>
<p>Our awareness - by which I mean our consciousness at it’s most
impersonal and fundamental level - is like a passive observer of things
which the occur in the field of awareness.</p>
<p>Throughout life, this awareness is observing a constructed inner a
world, a colourful, spatial, audible, tactile model of the world. It is
our minds which render a blade of glass to look green, or the sky to
look blue. The brain infers colour, it doesn’t exist in the same sense
in the outside world.</p>
<p>Colour is just a useful example here. The really interesting insight
is that this concept extends to all of human experience. We do not
experience the world directly, we are an awareness (within a mind,
within a body) which observes that which the mind generates. Your
reality is the understanding and experience you have of the world, but
those are <em>internal</em> phenomena. The illusion of consciousness to
to make make that “reality” feel external.</p>
