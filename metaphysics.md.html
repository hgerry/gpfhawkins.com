<h1 id="personal-metaphysical-reckoning">Personal metaphysical
reckoning</h1>
<p>I’ve written this as a line-in-the-sand for my currently
understanding or best-guess at how the mind and universe hold together.
This list is conjecture, things I currently think <em>may</em> be true,
and it will probably change over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>The mind and the body are inherently linked - matter is required to
support awareness</li>
<li>Everything is impermanent</li>
<li>Attachment leads to suffering</li>
<li>Awareness is generated from interaction between things</li>
<li>Consciousness is a self-aware awareness</li>
<li>Awareness is universal, and field-like. Physical structures allow
the field to be excited.</li>
<li>Things are realised when they appear in awareness</li>
<li>Self is an illusion (there are memories, thoughts, feelings, etc
arising within awareness - but the awareness that sees it all is
impersonal)</li>
<li>The mind acts as an aggregator of memory, thoughts, and senses.</li>
<li>Meditation is an exercise which helps to disaggregate things in
awareness, and helps to understand the mechanics of the mind</li>
<li>All things arising in awareness are equal</li>
<li>Awareness is impersonal, an identical shared phenomenon</li>
<li>“God” is this universal awareness</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="vault/lake.jpeg" /></p>
<p>…and the slightly more out-there stuff, which is conjecture rather
than insight, but which would be nice if true as it would map well onto
the framework I’ve outlined above:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is only present, past is just memories within awareness,
future never arrives</li>
<li>Physics is entirely relational, there is an all to all mapping
between matter. All matter has always existed and always will, what
changes are the relations. Time and distance are illusions of this
change.</li>
</ul>
