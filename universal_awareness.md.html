<h1 id="awareness-is-impersonal-and-universal">Awareness is impersonal,
and universal</h1>
<p>For me, the question arose spontaneously:</p>
<p>“What if everyone else feels <em>exactly</em> the same as you?”</p>
<p>Followed by:</p>
<p>“What if you’ve been assuming that your awareness is somehow uniquely
you, but actually experience feels <em>exactly</em> the same for
everyone?”</p>
<p>It was a light-bulb moment, the answers immediately apparent. My
understanding of the world shifted profoundly. My meditations up till
then had been forward-looking, and suddenly it was like a mirror
appeared before me - with an almost deja vu sense of “my” awareness
recognising itself for this first time in this body.</p>
<p>The days that followed were blissful. A deep, slow resonant sensation
when I tuned into the realisation, adopted the new perspective. A mind
constructs a model of the world. New information and experience is
mapped onto it. If the mapping if poor, an unpleasant tension arises. If
the mapping is good, then it feels good. A multitude of ideas, memories,
concepts - past and present - suddenly mapped perfectly. A deep sense of
peace persisted for a few days, before a fairly grim crash and eventual
return to a new normality.</p>
<p>It found this particular realisation somehow impossible to
communicate. Once it clicked, it felt almost obvious. I attempted to
explain it to someone else, but one can’t force the moment of
understanding. There’s the sense of this particular realisation being
somehow like a personal riddle.</p>
