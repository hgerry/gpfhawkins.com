<h1 id="its-all-in-the-mind">It’s all in the mind</h1>
<p>The normal experience of looking at an object is to feel as though
there is nothing at all between your conscious and the object. It feels
as though you are directly observing the actual object itself - but this
is not the case.</p>
<p>For a start, there are the obvious intermediaries - the lens, the
retina, the optic nerve, and so on - but the real magic of the
experience of consciousness is something that exists above all that. We
don’t simply become aware of the location and properties of the object,
as we might assume a computer system would, we have an conscious
experience of it.</p>
<p><img src="vault/field.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Our awareness - by which I mean our consciousness at it’s most
impersonal and fundamental level - is like a passive observer, with
things appearing in a field before it. Throughout life, this awareness
is observing a constructed inner world; a colourful, spatial, audible,
tactile, emotional world. It is our minds which render a blade of glass
to look green, or the sky to look blue. The brain generates the
experience of colour, it doesn’t exist in the same sense in the outside
world.</p>
<p>This idea extends beyond vision to all of human experience. We do not
experience the world directly, we are an awareness (within a mind,
within a body) which observes that which the mind generates. Your
reality is the understanding and experience you have of the world, but
those are <em>internal</em> phenomena. The illusion of consciousness is
to seamlessly aggregate these experiences, and to make the internal
reality feel external.</p>
